                The 'Men of valour' (MOV) is the men's arm of Intimate Vessels Church.
                 It is a strong and balanced Christian men's ministry built on the biblical framework to lead a potential
                  army of men into a deeper relationship and fellowship nwith the Lord. It was founded by Rev.David Akanwa 
                  since 2005 and has positively affected men all over the world by discovering their calling, vision, prosperity, 
                  divine health and authority in destiny and family. The International Headquarters is located at IVC Auditorium Awka,
                   Anambra State, Nigeria. It has also cultured men to seekafter Christ in character and truth. This was possible and 
                highly pursued through eight biblical-balanced keys for a healthy (spirit, soul and body) ministry to men:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>FILLING - God's man is a self-feeder who should consistently study and apply God's word independent
                         of the church or group he belongs. To do this, a man must be taught how to study the bible. this is 
                         supported by weekly meetings with
                         the pastor or small-group leader to teach Bible interpretation skills (1 Peter 2:1-3; Psalm 1:1-3).</p>
                         
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        TRAINING - God's man receives regular/weekly biblical instruction (1 Thessalonians 2;13). This is achieved through a weekly small/large-group Bible study with discussion.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        PRACTICING - God's man learns how to apply God's Word to all areas of life. It is essential to allowing room for accountability within the men's ministry for purpose of 
                        consistency and obedience to God's Word (James 1:22-25; Ezekiel 33:30-32).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        UNITING - God's man makes it a priority to connect with other men through outreaches at least two times a month 
                        for the purpose of community, accountability, confession,
                         and prayer (Galatians 6:1-3; James 5:16; Hebrews 10:23-24).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        SURVIVING - God's man learns to address major life temptations and/or crises according to his need and life-stage.
                         Support and encouragement from the ministry
                         leader and small group is essential (Ecclesiastes 4:9-12).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        REACHING - God's man gets involved in some form of men's ministry based on his gifts and talents. God has called each of us to pour out to others what He has poured into us (1 Peter 4:10-11; Ephesians 4:11-13).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        IMPACTING - God's man invests time and resources into the lives of other men. This is through one-on-one connection through shared activities, spiritual mentoring, and modeling (2 Tim. 2:22; 
                        Proverbs 27:17; Mark 3:13-14).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        SHARING - God's man learns to actively share his faith in order to lead others into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ 
                        (Acts 1:8; 1 Peter 3:15; Matthew 28:18-20).
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
