                Cause for which I live is built on my relationship with jesus. I first gave my life to Christ in 1988,
                in the Old scripture Union I got baptized in 1992, in Living Word Ministries. Characteristically, 
                in 1994 the inward fire kindled by genuine salvation kept me on the move as I crisscrossed my environment
                hunting for souls. 
                This became a lifestyle for me till 1996, June 19 to be precised, 
                when I had an opened daylight vision, which formed the nucleus of what stands today as Intimate Vessels’ Church.
                At the point, I was a student in federal polytechnic Nekede, serving as an evangelist under Wildfire Ministry Intl.
                This bright afternoon has I returned from class around 2pm, I lay on my bed having roommates around, suddenly,
                with my eyes wide open in a fashion that certified me that I was not asleep, my room was illuminated in a manner
                words may not attempt to describe. A sort of high voltage passed through my body. 
                My eyes were fixed on the doors as someone walked in. initially I didn’t see the person clearly the closer the person
                came, the clearer. 
                
            </p>

            <p>
                I recognized the person by miss Kathryn Kuhlman, arrayed in a long white gown possessing tiny gold
                droplets and a long white hair. Her soft misty eyes were fixed on me as she smiled towards me. Miss Kuhlman was a 
                healing evangelist of the 40s down to the early 60s. Her international Ministry, 
                in the world of Roberts Liardion laid a foundation for the workings of the holy spirit’ in her dispensation and beyond.
                Standing in front me, she didn’t utter a word, neither did I reached out to touch her, but I couldn’t. To the best of my ‘knowledge’, she stood in front of me for “ages”. At a point she turned and left with a broad smile. Jolting back into consciousness, I gazed around to knock whether I had an accomplice in what I transpired, but I didn’t know my class mates were totally disengaged from the questions I posed about what I witnessed. They went ahead to inform that it has been up to 5 minutes I walked in the room. At such, the weighing scale of time proffered a clear distinction between the two realms that was expressed in my room. I moved on with my life and service, as the effect of this encounter saw me strength my feet which I showed in the gospel of peace, knowing that whatever it is God wants to communicate to me will be unbuttoned with time. Indeed, December 4, 2001 brought me into another place of epoch. This time, I was in a vision of the night when a man, whose stature and aura defined him as Angel, made inscription on signpost, after which he raised it up before me and it read “Intimate vessels’ Church”. At this point the finger binding me “come” took a firm outlook. I shared this encounter with my then fiancé who is now my wife – Pastor Angela, and confessed to her that I wasn’t ready to do Church. The components of the demand didn’t elude me much because I’ve served in this capacity for some time, but I just wasn’t ready to pioneer any work. At such, I waited for another 4years to get clearer directions and connect the dots of his leading. By December 2005, the church was inaugurated, and officially kicked off in January 2006. Of all things I couldn’t lay my fingers on the scope of the assignment and ministry which has been committed into my hands, not until December 17, 2007 when I had another encounter which sharpened my perspective on the course. It was around 4am in the morning, when I heard an audible voice that said “ask of me and I will give the nation to you”. It was certain that someone spoke, but of a true, he could not be seen. I shared this with my wife and she assisted me in finding the portion of the scripture which read thus and it happened to be psalm 2:8 By this, is dawned on me that the commission was to have a worldwide impact. 
                On this wheel of ‘knowing as we follow on to know’ (Hos 6:2), God has led us to this point and yet MORE!
